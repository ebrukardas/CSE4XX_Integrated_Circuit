Inverter, 2 input nand, 2 input nor, 2 input xor, 2 input multiplexer design
These basic projects are design on Spice program.
Also all gates vectors (DC analysis) are compared.


SPICE is a general-purpose circuit simulation program for non-linear dc, 
non-linear transient, linear ac, and other kinds of analyses.
